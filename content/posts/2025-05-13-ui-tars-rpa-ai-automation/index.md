## How UI-TARS actually works

UI-TARS represents a fundamental departure from traditional GUI automation tools by integrating perception, reasoning, action, and memory into a single end-to-end model. Unlike frameworks that rely on wrapped commercial models with predefined workflows, UI-TARS uses a pure-vision approach that processes screenshots directly.

The architecture comprises four tightly integrated components:

1. **Perception System**: Processes screenshots to understand GUI elements, their relationships, and context. The model identifies buttons, text fields, and interactive components with **sub-5-pixel accuracy**, allowing for precise interactions.

2. **Reasoning Module**: Employs both System-1 (intuitive) and System-2 (deliberative) reasoning. For complex tasks, UI-TARS generates explicit "thoughts" that reflect its decision-making processâ€”similar to how humans might pause to think through a challenging interface.

3. **Action System**: Provides a unified framework for standardizing actions across platforms, including mouse operations, keyboard inputs, mobile gestures, and system navigation commands.

4. **Memory Component**: Stores task-specific information and relevant background knowledge, enabling the model to maintain context across extended interactions.

The system works through an iterative execution loop: receiving a task instruction, processing visual input, generating reasoning thoughts, executing actions, observing results, and repeating until completion. This approach allows UI-TARS to adapt to unfamiliar interfaces without requiring predefined workflows.
