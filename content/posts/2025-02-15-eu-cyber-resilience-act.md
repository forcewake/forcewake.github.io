## Executive Summary

The **EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA)** is a groundbreaking regulation establishing mandatory cybersecurity standards for most hardware and software products with digital elements in the EU. It aims to **embed cybersecurity “by design and by default”** across the product lifecycle – from development through post-sales support – to safeguard consumers and businesses from insecure technology ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20,with%20the%20proper%20cybersecurity%20features)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20EU%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Act,can%20take%20to%20ensure%20compliance)). The CRA applies broadly to connected products (including IoT devices, software, and hardware) offered on the EU market, imposing obligations on manufacturers (and other supply-chain operators) to ensure ongoing product security and swift vulnerability management. Key principles include **secure product design, regular security updates for at least 5 years, incident and vulnerability reporting within 24 hours**, and increased accountability via CE marking and documentation. Non-compliance can trigger fines up to €15 million or 2.5% of global turnover ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=Non,fiscal%20year%2C%20whichever%20is%20higher)). The CRA complements existing EU laws like GDPR, NIS2, and the proposed AI Act, closing gaps and creating a more cohesive cybersecurity framework. This report provides both a high-level overview and an in-depth breakdown of CRA’s scope, requirements, and implications, with tailored guidance for tech companies, IoT manufacturers, and financial institutions on achieving compliance in a cost-effective, phased manner.


## 1. CRA Compliance Overview

**Objectives and Purpose:** The Cyber Resilience Act is the EU’s first comprehensive law to improve the cybersecurity of digital products. Its core objective is to **“safeguard consumers and businesses buying software or hardware products with a digital component”** by addressing the currently inadequate security in many such products ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20,with%20the%20proper%20cybersecurity%20features)). The CRA targets problems like *widespread product vulnerabilities, lack of timely security updates, and difficulty for users to assess and maintain product security*. By introducing common EU-wide rules, the CRA seeks to **raise the baseline of cybersecurity** across all products with digital elements, making security a built-in feature rather than an afterthought ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20CRA%20introduces%20mandatory%20cybersecurity,sold%20in%20the%20EU%20market)). In essence, any product that can connect to another device or network must meet cybersecurity standards, shifting responsibility to manufacturers to ensure safety “out of the box” and throughout the product’s life ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20regulation%20applies%20to%20all,marked%20products)).

**Key Compliance Principles:** Several high-level principles underpin the CRA’s requirements:

- **Security by Design & Default:** Products must be designed, developed, and configured with an appropriate level of security from the outset, based on risk ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,of%20stored%2C%20transmitted%20or%20otherwise)). Secure defaults are mandatory – for example, devices should ship with secure settings (no universal default passwords, minimal open ports) and have automatic security updates enabled by default (with an easy opt-out) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,out%20mechanism)). This ensures that even non-expert users enjoy strong protection without special configuration.

- **Lifecycle Security & Updates:** Cybersecurity is a continuous obligation. Manufacturers must monitor and maintain products over their **“support period”** – providing security updates and patches free of charge for a minimum of 5 years (or the product’s expected lifetime, if shorter) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=The%20support%20period%20for%20which,Where)) ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,for%20at%20least%2010%20years)). This long-term support is meant to tackle the common issue of devices becoming insecure after manufacturers stop updates. Importantly, manufacturers must specify to customers how long security support will last and notify users when support is ending ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=obliged%20to%20release%20free%20update,warning%20and%2072%20hours%20of)) ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,of%20conformity%20assessment%20may%20be)).

- **Risk Assessment and Mitigation:** Before a product is placed on the market, manufacturers are required to perform thorough **cybersecurity risk assessments**. This means identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts, then designing the product to mitigate those risks ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,and%20instructions%20for%20safe%20use)). The risk assessment must be documented and updated as needed, guiding security measures at each stage of development and deployment ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,cannot%20be%20shorter%20than%2010)).

- **Vulnerability Handling & Transparency:** The CRA mandates a proactive approach to vulnerabilities. Manufacturers need processes to *identify, track, and remediate* vulnerabilities in their products. They must implement **“coordinated vulnerability disclosure” policies**, maintain a listing of components (e.g. a Software Bill of Materials, SBOM) to trace vulnerabilities, and quickly issue fixes ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20specific%20vulnerability%20handling%20requirements,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)). Moreover, after releasing a security fix, manufacturers must **inform users and the public** about the vulnerability and remediate steps – including a description of the issue, affected products, severity, and guidance for users ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20also%20need%20to,need%20to%20be%20in%20place)). This transparency helps users protect themselves and raises awareness of product security status.

- **Accountability via Conformity & CE Marking:** The CRA follows the EU’s New Legislative Framework for product safety. Manufacturers must ensure compliance with **essential cybersecurity requirements (detailed in the CRA’s Annex I)** and formally **declare conformity** before marketing a product. Conforming products will bear the **CE marking** to signify they meet EU cybersecurity standards ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20regulation%20applies%20to%20all,marked%20products)). In many cases, manufacturers can self-assess compliance, but higher-risk products require **third-party assessment or certification** (see Section 3). By affixing CE marking, manufacturers assume liability that their product is secure. Distributors and importers, in turn, must verify that products they sell bear the CE mark and have the required documentation ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20CRA%20establishes%20a%20comprehensive,of%20obligations%20on%20OSS%20stewards)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=3,as%C2%A0information%20and%20instructions%20for%20users)).

In summary, the CRA’s overarching philosophy is **“secure products throughout their lifecycle”**, achieved by robust design, continuous risk management, prompt incident handling, and clear accountability. These principles apply broadly, but specific obligations and how they are fulfilled can vary by product type and risk category, as detailed in later sections.

## 2. Scope of the CRA

**Covered Products and Entities:** The CRA’s scope is *very broad*. It applies to essentially all “**products with digital elements**” made available on the EU market, **“whose intended or reasonably foreseeable use includes a direct or indirect logical or physical data connection to a device or network.”** ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20CRA%E2%80%99s%20material%20scope%20is,1%20CRA)). In practical terms, this means **any software or hardware product that can connect to the internet or another device** is in scope. This includes: consumer IoT devices (smart cameras, TVs, toys, wearable gadgets, home appliances), computing hardware (phones, laptops, routers, industrial control systems), and *stand-alone software* (operating systems, mobile apps, desktop applications, firewalls, anti-virus, database software, etc.) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=separately,video%20games%20and%20desktop%20applications)) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Products%20with%20digital%20elements%20will,cybersecurity%20based%20on%20the%20risks)). Even software components or cloud-based services that are part of a product’s functionality (remote data processing necessary for the product to operate) fall under the CRA’s umbrella when provided by the product manufacturer ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=a%C2%A0product%20with%20digital%20elements%20to,In%20such%20a%C2%A0case%2C%20the%20service)). In short, **if a product contains digital code and connectivity, it likely falls under the CRA**.

**Excluded Items:** Despite its broad reach, the CRA explicitly *excludes* certain products that are already regulated by equally stringent sector-specific rules or other considerations. Notable exclusions are:  

- **Medical devices**, **vehicles**, **civil aviation products**, and other regulated sectors – these are covered by existing EU laws which include cybersecurity requirements (for example, the Medical Devices Regulation, or vehicle type-approval regulations) ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20regulation%20applies%20to%20all,marked%20products)) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Excluded%20from%20the%20scope%20are,and%20defense%20purposes%2C%20among%20others)). The CRA avoids duplicating or conflicting with those regimes.  
- **Products developed exclusively for national security or military purposes**, and products designed to process classified information ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=While%20the%20CRA%E2%80%99s%20objective%20is,designed%20to%20process%20classified%20information)). These fall outside EU internal market rules.  
- **Non-commercial Open-Source Software (OSS):** *Free and open-source software* that is **not supplied as part of a commercial activity** is exempt ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=Regulation%2C%20only%20free%20and%20open,digital%20elements%20has%20been%20developed)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20broad%20wording%20of%20this,19%29%20CRA)). For example, a hobbyist’s open-source project shared freely online is not subject to CRA compliance. The rationale is to protect the open-source ecosystem from undue burden. However, if open-source software is packaged and sold as part of a product or service for profit, or if a company develops OSS as a key part of its business, then it *would* fall under the CRA (or the company would be considered an “OSS steward” with lighter obligations) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=match%20at%20L741%20digital%20elements,activities%2C%20and%20who%20play%20a%C2%A0main)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20CRA%20addresses%20various%20%E2%80%9Ceconomic,3%20%2814%29%20CRA)). In practice, this means commercial vendors remain responsible for the security of open-source components they include in their products – they must exercise due diligence to ensure those components are secure (e.g. checking for known vulnerabilities, updates) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=exercise%20due%20diligence%20with%20regard,in%20the%20European%20vulnerability%20database)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=with%20this%20Regulation%2C%20including%20by,apply%20to%20products%20with%20digital)).

**EU-Based vs. Non-EU Entities:** The CRA follows the **“marketplace principle”** for territorial scope ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20the%20territorial,the%20CRA%20is%20in%20effect)). It doesn’t matter where a company is located – if you want to *sell or distribute a digital product in the EU*, the CRA applies. Non-EU manufacturers must comply fully when offering products in the EU and will typically need to appoint an **authorized representative in the EU** to handle compliance duties. Importers and distributors in the EU also bear responsibility to ensure foreign-made products meet CRA requirements before they reach consumers ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20CRA%20addresses%20various%20%E2%80%9Ceconomic,3%20%2814%29%20CRA)). In effect, the CRA has **global reach**: a U.S. or Asia-based tech company selling software in Europe must build CRA requirements into its products, just as an EU-based company would. Products that fail to comply can be denied entry or pulled from the EU market by regulators. This extraterritorial impact is similar to what was seen with GDPR – the EU is leveraging its market size to drive higher security standards internationally.

**Product Categories (Hardware, Software, IoT):** The CRA does not separate rules by “hardware vs software” – both are covered under the umbrella of *“products with digital elements.”* However, it does differentiate products by *risk profile* (see Section 3 below on “critical” vs “important” vs “normal” products). In practice:

- Pure **software** (like apps, operating systems, security software) is in scope if it’s made available to end users in the EU ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20CRA%E2%80%99s%20material%20scope%20is,1%20CRA)). For example, a downloadable mobile app or PC software is a product under the CRA. Software updates themselves are considered part of the product lifecycle – significant updates may even trigger re-assessment for compliance if they substantially change the product’s security profile ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=update%2C%20such%20as%20a%C2%A0visual%20enhancement,is%20considered%20to%20be%20a%C2%A0substantial)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=In%20line%20with%20the%20commonly,intended%20purpose%20of%20that%20product)).
- **Hardware devices** with connectivity (from microcontrollers to smart appliances) are squarely in scope. They must meet CRA design requirements (secure default config, etc.) and their embedded software/firmware is included in the compliance evaluation. Manufacturers of hardware will need to ensure both the physical device and its digital components (firmware, OS) are secure.
- **IoT devices** (Internet of Things) are a major focus of the CRA, since many IoT products historically had poor security. All IoT gadgets – whether consumer (e.g. smart bulbs, wearables) or industrial (sensors, smart meters) – must comply, unless specifically exempted (like a medical IoT device would follow medical device rules). The CRA’s requirements (no default passwords, resilience to network attacks, etc.) are directly applicable to IoT. Even very simple “smart” devices must be assessed for cyber risks. One small carve-out is for *spare parts* that are only intended to replace components of an existing product ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=While%20the%20CRA%E2%80%99s%20objective%20is,designed%20to%20process%20classified%20information)) (so, a replacement part that isn’t independently functional might not need separate certification).

In summary, **any organization that manufactures or sells digital tech products in the EU – be it a SaaS software vendor, an IoT gadget maker, or an enterprise hardware supplier – will likely have products in scope**. Companies should carefully inventory their offerings to determine which fall under the CRA’s definition and note any exceptions that might apply. The next sections will outline what compliance for those in-scope products entails.

## 3. Key Obligations and Requirements under the CRA

The CRA imposes a comprehensive set of **legal and technical requirements** on “economic operators” (primarily manufacturers, but also importers and distributors) to ensure products meet high cybersecurity standards. These can be grouped into several major obligation areas:

### **3.1 Essential Cybersecurity Requirements (Secure by Design)**

Manufacturers must design and develop products to comply with a list of **“essential cybersecurity requirements”** detailed in the CRA (Annex I). These are effectively *built-in security features and properties* that every covered product should have before it is placed on the market. In summary, products must be designed to ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,risks%2C%20prevent%20and%20mitigate%20security)):

- **Be free of known vulnerabilities:** A product should **not be shipped with any known exploitable vulnerabilities**. Before release, manufacturers need to eliminate or mitigate known security flaws (for example, by using up-to-date components and performing security testing) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,be%20addressed%20through%20security%20updates)). If a vulnerability is discovered just before or after release, it needs addressing via updates, but the goal is to avoid known issues at launch.

- **Secure settings and configurations:** Products should have **secure defaults** and settings that minimize risk. This includes requiring unique or no default passwords, disabling unnecessary services by default, and providing only the minimum necessary privileges. The CRA explicitly expects a *“secure-by-default configuration”*, and even requires that users be able to reset the product to original secure settings easily ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,of%20stored%2C%20transmitted%20or%20otherwise)). By default, devices should also enable automatic installation of security updates (with an option for users to opt-out, should they choose) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,out%20mechanism)).

- **Access control and unauthorized access prevention:** Adequate **authentication and access control mechanisms** must be in place to prevent unauthorized use. Depending on the product, this could mean enforcing strong password policies, multi-factor authentication, robust identity management, or other controls so that only authorized individuals/devices can access sensitive functions ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,configuration%20against%20any%20manipulation%20or)). For example, an IoT camera should require a proper login and not allow anonymous access; software should have proper role-based access if multi-user.

- **Data confidentiality:** Products must protect the confidentiality of any data they handle (whether personal data or not). In practice, this often means using **state-of-the-art encryption** or cryptographic measures for data at rest and in transit ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,of%20essential%20functions%2C%20including%20the)). If a device transmits data to the cloud, that communication should be encrypted; if it stores sensitive info on disk or memory, it should consider encryption or proper access controls to that data.

- **Data integrity:** The integrity of data, code, and commands must be preserved. Products should be designed to **prevent and detect tampering or manipulation** of data and software ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=or%20in%20transit%20by%20state,attack%20surface%20limitation%20to%20minimise)). This could involve using digital signatures to ensure code has not been altered, checksums for firmware, verifying update packages, and protecting configuration settings from unauthorized changes.

- **Data minimization:** In line with privacy principles, products should **collect and process only the data absolutely necessary** for their intended function ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,intended%20purpose%20of%20a%20PDE)). Unnecessary data exposure or collection increases risk. The CRA ties this to cybersecurity by reducing the amount of sensitive data that could be compromised if an attack occurs. For example, an IoT device should not continuously collect personal data it doesn’t need.

- **Ensure availability and resilience of critical functions:** Products should maintain the **availability** of essential services even under attack. They must be resilient against disruptions like Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=intended%20purpose%20of%20a%20PDE%3B,attack%20surface%20limitation%20to%20minimise)). This might mean implementing rate limiting, having fallback modes, or gracefully degrading non-critical functions to keep core functions running. Critical devices should be able to withstand a certain level of network flooding or recover quickly.

- **Minimize attack surfaces:** The product’s design should limit potential entry points for attackers ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,potential%20entry%20points%20for%20cyberattacks)). This ties into secure configuration – e.g., disable unused ports and interfaces, remove debug or test backdoors, use principles of least functionality. The product should expose only what is necessary, thereby reducing opportunities for exploitation.

- **Secure communication and update mechanisms:** Although not listed explicitly above, an implied requirement is that any update mechanism or network communication of the product must itself be secure (using secure protocols, authenticating updates, etc.), to prevent those channels from becoming attack vectors.

- **Logging and monitoring (security logs):** The final essential requirement mentioned in summaries is that products should **provide security logs** ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=Act%2C%20including%20that%20the%20products,risks%3B%20and%20provide%20security%20logs)). That means they should be capable of logging security-relevant events (login attempts, significant configuration changes, anomalies, etc.) in a way that admins or users can review. This helps in detecting breaches or misuse. The CRA includes logging to ensure that if an incident happens, there’s data to analyze how it occurred.

- **Data removal & portability:** Users must have the option to **easily remove personal data and reset settings** on the device, and where applicable, to export their data securely ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=known%20exploitable%20vulnerabilities.%20Post%20market,systems%20in%20a%20secure%20manner)). This ensures that when a user decommissions a product, they can wipe sensitive information (protecting confidentiality beyond the product’s use) and retrieve their data to move to another system (an echo of GDPR’s data portability principle). For instance, a smart appliance might allow the owner to factory-reset and erase all personal info; an app might allow exporting user-created content before deletion.

These essential requirements are technology-neutral but set a clear bar for product security features. Manufacturers will likely leverage standards (such as **EN 303 645 for IoT security** ([](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20Requirements%20Standards%20Mapping%20-%20final_with_identifiers_0.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L5086%20Annex%20I%2C,on%20all%20the%20requirements%2C%20which)), ISO/IEC 27001/ 62443, etc.) to meet these criteria. Compliance will often involve **embedding security testing in development (SDLC)**, performing threat modeling, and following best practices (like no hardcoded credentials, using secure libraries, etc.). The CRA’s essential requirements align with widely accepted security best practices and even overlap with GDPR’s requirement for “security by design” for personal data ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=match%20at%20L992%20operations%20could,requirements%20laid%20down%20in%20this)) – but here they are enforceable for all digital products, not just where personal data is involved.

### **3.2 Vulnerability Handling and Software Updates (Post-Market Requirements)**

Beyond initial design, the CRA places heavy emphasis on how manufacturers handle security issues **throughout the product’s lifecycle**:

- **Continuous Monitoring:** Manufacturers must **monitor for vulnerabilities** or threats related to their products once in use. This means maintaining awareness (e.g., monitoring vulnerability databases for issues in included components, or listening to security researchers’ reports) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=purpose%2C%20take%20into%20account%20one,out%20in%20this%20Regulation%2C%20which)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=as%20by%20checking%20its%20security,of%20the%20product%20with%20digital)). If a vulnerability in the product or one of its components is discovered, the manufacturer has a duty to act.

- **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD):** Each manufacturer needs a policy and process for **coordinated vulnerability disclosure** ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20specific%20vulnerability%20handling%20requirements,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20also%20need%20to,need%20to%20be%20in%20place)). This typically involves providing a clear contact point for researchers to report vulnerabilities, a process to investigate and fix them, and a way to inform the reporter and public of the outcome. Many companies will need to set up or enhance their **Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT)** for this purpose.

- **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** The CRA explicitly requires manufacturers to **identify and document components contained in the product**, potentially via an SBOM ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20specific%20vulnerability%20handling%20requirements,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)). At minimum, the *“top-level dependencies”* must be documented in a machine-readable format ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20of%20products%20with%20digital,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)). This inventory of components (libraries, modules, open-source packages, etc.) is crucial for checking known vulnerabilities (e.g., if a popular library gets a security bug, the manufacturer can quickly see which products use it). It also aids customers or regulators in understanding the product’s supply chain of software.

- **Timely Security Updates:** Upon discovering a vulnerability, manufacturers **must remediate without undue delay**. Security patches or updates should be developed, tested, and **provided to users free of charge** as soon as possible ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=document%20vulnerabilities%20and%20components%20contained,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)). The CRA mandates that security updates cannot be behind a paywall or subscription – all users must get them freely. Moreover, these updates should not worsen the product’s safety; they should effectively reduce risk (an expectation to follow secure update practices).

- **Update Availability and Legacy Support:** As noted, manufacturers have to keep issuing necessary security updates throughout the committed support period (at least 5 years). The final CRA text clarifies that once an update is released, it should remain available for download for at least **10 years** ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,for%20at%20least%2010%20years)), even if the user chooses to apply it later. This ensures devices can be patched even long after sale (useful if a device is offline for a while or if an organization needs to re-install an update later). Importantly, if a product undergoes a **“substantial modification”** (e.g., a major software version upgrade) that changes its intended purpose or risk profile, that new version is treated as a new product that must comply with CRA independently ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=update%2C%20such%20as%20a%C2%A0visual%20enhancement,is%20considered%20to%20be%20a%C2%A0substantial)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=Taking%20into%20account%20the%20iterative,hardware%2C%20such%20as%20a%C2%A0faster%20central)). However, the CRA allows that if a manufacturer moves to a new version, they can focus updates on the latest version *provided users can freely upgrade to it and hardware can support it* ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=that%20have%20placed%20subsequent%20versions,hardware%2C%20such%20as%20a%C2%A0faster%20central)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=minor%20security%20or%20functionality%20updates,system%20for%20the%20support%20period)). For example, if a software moves from v1 to v2 as a substantial change, the vendor should ensure all v1 users can move to v2 at no cost, then v1 may only get limited security fixes (or users encouraged to upgrade).

- **User Advisories and Disclosure:** When a security update is released, the manufacturer must accompany it with **advisory information to users** ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=document%20vulnerabilities%20and%20components%20contained,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)). This includes explaining what vulnerability was fixed, what the potential impact was, and any actions users might need to take (e.g., reboot device, change passwords, etc.). Additionally, the CRA expects public disclosure of fixed vulnerabilities (likely via security advisories or databases) so that the wider community is aware of issues and fixes ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20also%20need%20to,need%20to%20be%20in%20place)). This level of transparency is meant to foster trust and allow users (or enterprises) to gauge the risk of using a product.

- **End-of-Life Notification:** Manufacturers need to clearly communicate the **end date of security support** for each product ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=obliged%20to%20release%20free%20update,warning%20and%2072%20hours%20of)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=of%20time,aware%20for%20the%20complete%20notification)). Users should be **notified when the support period is ending** ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=obliged%20to%20release%20free%20update,warning%20and%2072%20hours%20of)), so they understand that after that point, no further security patches will come. This allows users to make informed decisions (such as upgrading to a newer model or adding additional protections). Notifications should be made in a way that effectively reaches users without being overly intrusive ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=match%20at%20L1506%20reached%20the,the%20product%20with%20digital%20elements)).

In summary, the CRA effectively obliges companies to operate an ongoing vulnerability management program for their products. This is a shift from the old “ship and forget” model to a **“ship, monitor, and fix”** model. For many IoT and software companies, this means establishing new internal processes and possibly service infrastructure (e.g., update delivery mechanisms, vulnerability intake processes). The benefit for users is that products should remain safe to use for their expected lifetime, and if problems arise, they will be informed and protected in a timely manner.

### **3.3 Incident and Vulnerability Reporting Obligations**

The CRA introduces **mandatory reporting** to authorities for serious security issues:

- **Report to Authorities within 24 hours:** If a manufacturer becomes aware of an **actively exploited vulnerability** in their product, or any **incident that has a significant impact on the product’s security**, they must report it to the relevant authorities **“without undue delay and in any event within 24 hours”** ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20need%20to%20report,to%20determine%20the%20competent%20CSIRT)). This report is an *early warning*, not necessarily with full details, but enough to alert that a serious issue is at hand ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20need%20to%20report,to%20determine%20the%20competent%20CSIRT)). The report is to be made to the competent national **Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)** and to **ENISA** (the EU Agency for Cybersecurity) via a centralized platform ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20need%20to%20report,to%20determine%20the%20competent%20CSIRT)). Essentially, the EU wants a heads-up about emerging threats in products so that authorities can coordinate response or warn users if needed.

- **Follow-up reports (72 hours and 14 days):** After the initial 24h notification, manufacturers are generally required to provide a more detailed **incident report within 72 hours**, and possibly a final assessment or report within 14 days ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20need%20to%20report,to%20determine%20the%20competent%20CSIRT)). The 72-hour report would include more comprehensive information on the vulnerability/incident, root cause if known, and mitigation measures. The 14-day report could provide updates on remediation status and impact. (These timelines mirror, to some extent, personal-data breach reports under GDPR, but here it’s about product cybersecurity incidents.)

- **Notify Users:** In addition to authorities, affected **users must be informed without undue delay** about incidents that impact the security of the product ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=accessible%20to%20ENISA)). If a vulnerability is being actively exploited in the wild, the manufacturer should alert users (e.g., via email, in-app notification, etc.) and advise on how to mitigate (such as disconnecting the product, applying a patch, or other steps). This user notification is crucial to minimize harm – for instance, if a smart thermostat has a vulnerability being hit by a botnet, users might be told to apply a firmware update immediately or temporarily take it offline.

- **Determining the CSIRT:** The law specifies rules for which CSIRT is “competent” to receive the report (likely based on the manufacturer’s main EU establishment or where the incident impacts, as per NIS2 framework) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Manufacturers%20will%20need%20to%20report,to%20determine%20the%20competent%20CSIRT)). In practice, a single portal might be used to streamline this, with ENISA access. The idea is not to overburden with multiple reports – one notification should reach both national and EU authorities ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20intention%20is%20for%20notifications,simultaneously%20be%20accessible%20to%20ENISA)).

These reporting obligations mean that manufacturers must have internal incident response capabilities to detect and assess exploits quickly. Notably, failure to report in time is an offense that can incur fines. Also, there’s an overlap with NIS2 for some companies (see Section 4) – but CRA focuses on product-centric incidents, whereas NIS2 is about incidents affecting essential services.

### **3.4 Documentation and Transparency Requirements**

To support compliance and help users, the CRA requires substantial **technical documentation and user instructions** to be produced:

- **Technical Documentation:** Manufacturers must compile technical files demonstrating the product’s conformity with CRA requirements ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=2,by%20the%20CRA%20are%20met)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=3,as%C2%A0information%20and%20instructions%20for%20users)). This likely includes the risk assessment report, design details on how security requirements are met, test reports or certifications obtained, the SBOM, and the vulnerability handling policies. This documentation must be kept up-to-date and provided to regulators (market surveillance authorities) upon request. Essentially, if challenged, a manufacturer should be able to **show evidence of how they built security in** and how they manage vulnerabilities.

- **User Instructions and Security Information:** Clear user-facing documentation is also mandated ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,for%20at%20least%2010%20years)). This includes instructions for the secure setup and use of the product, explanations of security features, and any conditions for safe operation. For instance, if a software needs certain secure configuration or an IoT device should be placed behind a firewall, those recommendations should be in the manual. Instructions must be in **“clear and intelligible language”** for the target user group and in the official language(s) of the markets where the product is sold ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,users%20and%20market%20surveillance%20authorities)). Users should also be informed how to install updates and contact support or report issues. Additionally, the product’s **security support period (end-of-support date)** must be communicated to users upfront ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=obliged%20to%20release%20free%20update,and%20ENISA%20via%20the%20incident)).

- **CE Mark and EU Declaration of Conformity:** As a regulation using the CE marking framework, manufacturers will need to draft an **EU Declaration of Conformity** for each product, stating it meets CRA requirements, and affix the **CE mark** on the product or packaging ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20regulation%20applies%20to%20all,marked%20products)). Alongside CE, products might come with a QR code or reference to online info where users or regulators can find the declaration and perhaps a summary of cybersecurity features. This visible marking is a transparency measure allowing buyers to know the product adheres to EU cyber standards.

- **Retention of Records:** Manufacturers and importers must retain the technical documentation and conformity declarations for at least 10 years after the product is last placed on the market ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,of%20conformity%20assessment%20may%20be)). This ensures that even years later, if a product issue arises, documentation is available.

Collectively, these documentation requirements ensure both **regulators can assess compliance** and **users are empowered to use products securely**. For companies, this means investing in better user manuals (with sections on security) and maintaining organized compliance files. While it introduces overhead, it also can reduce support costs and incidents if users have proper guidance.

### **3.5 Conformity Assessment and Certification**

Before selling a product, manufacturers must carry out a **conformity assessment** to verify it meets the CRA’s requirements. The CRA adapts a *risk-based approach* for conformity assessment:

- **Self-assessment for Most Products:** Approximately **90% of products (the “non-critical” category)** are expected to go through *internal conformity assessment* ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20set%20of%20CRA%20obligations,products%20on%20the%20EU%20market)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Non)). Here, the manufacturer itself checks and declares that the product fulfills the essential requirements (often by following harmonized standards or internal testing). This is similar to the self-declaration in low-risk product regimes like many toys or electronics today. Manufacturers will use standards and best practices as a guide, and then sign off on compliance.

- **Third-Party Assessment for Higher-Risk Products:** For more sensitive product categories, an independent **Notified Body** or accredited lab must be involved. The CRA defines two tiers of higher-risk products:
  - **“Important” products (Class I and Class II):** These are listed in **Annex III** of the regulation ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Some%20products%20with%20digital%20elements,amended%20by%20the%20European%20Commission)) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Annex%20III%20of%20the%20CRA,amended%20by%20the%20European%20Commission)). They include products that perform critical security functions for other systems or whose compromise could have large-scale impacts (for example: network routers and switches, operating systems, IAM (identity and access management) systems, password managers, firewalls, antivirus, industrial control systems, etc.) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Annex%20III%20of%20the%20CRA,be%20amended%20by%20the%20European)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=General%20%2B%20additional%20requirements%20%28Art,6%20and%207%20CRA)). Important products are subdivided (Class I and II) based on technical criteria and examples, but both classes face **“additional requirements”** beyond the general ones ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=General%20%2B%20additional%20requirements%20%28Art,6%20and%207%20CRA)). Under Article 7 CRA, these likely need a **conformity assessment with involvement of a third-party** (e.g., a type examination or an audit of the manufacturer’s processes) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Important%20)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Container%20or%20virtual%20machines%2C%20firewalls%2C,Annex%20III%20CRA)). The exact procedure can vary (some may allow a manufacturer’s ISO 27001-certified processes to be considered, others might require specific testing by the Notified Body). The key is an external check on the product’s security.
  - **“Critical” products (highest risk):** Listed in **Annex IV** ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Some%20products%20with%20digital%20elements,amended%20by%20the%20European%20Commission)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Critical)), these are a smaller set of products that either are heavily depended upon by critical infrastructure (essential entities under NIS2) or whose failure could disrupt critical supply chains across the EU ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Core%20functionality%20of%20one%20of,listed%20in%20Annex%20IV%20CRA)). Examples are hardware security modules or cryptographic processors, certain security gateways, digital identity wallets, and other advanced security products ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=General%20%2B%20additional%20requirements%20%28Art,6%20and%208%20CRA)). For these, the CRA requires **EU cybersecurity certification** under the framework of the Cybersecurity Act (Regulation (EU) 2019/881) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=smartcards%20or%20similar%20devices,amended%20by%20the%20European%20Commission)). In other words, if there’s an existing European cybersecurity certification scheme (such as Common Criteria or an EUCC scheme at “substantial” or “high” assurance), the manufacturer must obtain a certificate to demonstrate compliance ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=smartcards%20or%20similar%20devices,amended%20by%20the%20European%20Commission)). If no appropriate scheme exists yet, a Notified Body conformity assessment will be needed in the interim. The Commission can also mandate specific certifications for these categories via future delegated acts ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=ensure%20a%C2%A0common%20adequate%20cybersecurity%20protection,certification%20where%20a%C2%A0relevant%20European%20cybersecurity)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=match%20at%20L1286%20a%C2%A0category%20of,the%20level%20of%20cybersecurity%20risk)). The target assurance level for critical products is at least “substantial” (or possibly “high” if used in especially sensitive contexts) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=a%C2%A0category%20of%20critical%20products%20with,the%20level%20of%20cybersecurity%20risk)).

In practice, companies will need to check Annex III and IV to see if their product falls under those lists. For instance, a manufacturer of smart toys or wearable health trackers will find those in Annex III (important products) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Annex%20III%20of%20the%20CRA,be%20amended%20by%20the%20European)), meaning extra scrutiny, whereas a maker of a generic smart lightbulb might be non-critical (self-assess). The conformity process will involve testing products against standards and preparing the technical documentation showing all requirements are met.

**Penalties for Non-Compliance:** The CRA comes with teeth: Regulators (market surveillance authorities) can issue **administrative fines up to €15 million or 2.5% of the company’s worldwide annual turnover** for the preceding year (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=Non,fiscal%20year%2C%20whichever%20is%20higher)) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=)). Lesser offenses have lower caps (e.g. 1.5% turnover for certain failures), but in any case, the fines are significant, akin to GDPR levels (though GDPR goes to 4% turnover). Additionally, authorities can **ban or recall products** that don’t comply, issue warnings, and require remedies. For companies in the tech and IoT sector, these penalties underscore that CRA compliance is not optional – it’s a legal requirement with substantial financial and reputational risks for failure.

**Summary of Obligations:** To recap, a manufacturer under CRA must: conduct risk assessments; embed security in design (covering confidentiality, integrity, etc.); ensure no known vulns at release; provide for encryption, access control, and logging; maintain and update products for 5+ years; implement vulnerability disclosure and patch processes; document everything (including SBOM and user guidance); undergo appropriate conformity checks (self or third-party); mark the product and report serious issues promptly ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,risks%2C%20prevent%20and%20mitigate%20security)) ([Council of the European Union Adopts the Cyber Resilience Act](https://www.hunton.com/privacy-and-information-security-law/council-of-the-european-union-adopts-the-cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=,party%20suppliers)). Authorized representatives (if the manufacturer is abroad) must hold documentation and cooperate with authorities. Importers must verify that the product has CE marking, required documentation, and that the manufacturer has complied (they essentially act as an additional gatekeeper) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=,verify%20that%20other%20key%20requirements)). Distributors must not supply products they know are non-compliant and must handle recalls or notifications if issues arise.

The CRA thus creates an end-to-end compliance ecosystem ensuring that cybersecurity is accounted for from the factory to the end-user.

## 4. Interaction with Other EU Laws (GDPR, NIS2, AI Act, etc.)

The CRA is part of a broader EU cybersecurity and digital regulation strategy. It has been designed to **complement** and **work in tandem** with other laws, minimizing conflicts. Key interactions include:

- **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):** GDPR focuses on personal data protection, requiring organizations to secure personal data (Art. 32) and report personal data breaches. The CRA, by contrast, focuses on product security irrespective of data. They intersect in that a security vulnerability in a product could lead to a personal data breach. **Compliance with CRA’s security requirements will inherently support GDPR compliance** (by reducing breach likelihood) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=match%20at%20L992%20operations%20could,requirements%20laid%20down%20in%20this)). For example, a smart device that encrypts user data and is secure by design is less likely to cause a GDPR-reportable incident. The CRA also echoes GDPR’s principles like data minimization and “privacy by design” (CRA explicitly mandates minimizing data processed ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,intended%20purpose%20of%20a%20PDE))). In case of an incident, companies might have dual reporting duties – e.g., if a hacker exploits a product vulnerability and accesses personal data, the manufacturer might report under CRA to ENISA/CSIRT and also notify data protection authorities under GDPR. Recognizing such overlaps, the CRA encourages cooperation between market surveillance authorities and data protection authorities ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=Agency%20for%20Cybersecurity%20,relevant%20for%20accomplishing%20their%20tasks)). This means in enforcement, if a product insecurity causes data issues, authorities may coordinate their investigation or share information. However, **no direct legal conflict** exists: organizations must simply comply with both. One potential challenge is that CRA requires public disclosure of fixed vulnerabilities, and if those involve personal data breaches, companies must ensure GDPR rules on breach notifications are also respected (timing and content of notices might need alignment). Overall, GDPR and CRA are seen as complementary – one protects personal data, the other ensures the products themselves are secure, which in turn protects personal data.

- **NIS2 Directive (Directive (EU) 2022/2555):** NIS2 is aimed at improving cybersecurity for **essential and important entities** (critical infrastructure sectors, large digital services, etc.). It imposes security measures and incident reporting obligations on those organizations (e.g., hospitals, cloud providers, energy companies). The CRA **complements NIS2** by securing the products that those entities (and everyone) use ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20CRA%20builds%20on%20the,area%2C%20specifically%20the%20NIS2%20Directive)). For instance, NIS2 might require a hospital (as an essential entity) to manage cybersecurity risks in their operations, including risks from ICT products they deploy. CRA ensures that the medical device or software they purchase is built securely to begin with, thus reducing supply-chain risk. There is a deliberate delineation: **CRA regulates the *product manufacturers***, while **NIS2 regulates the *operators of essential services***. They do intersect on **incident reporting**: an essential service provider under NIS2 must report incidents affecting their service, which could include incidents stemming from product vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the product’s manufacturer must report under CRA. These parallel reports might concern the same incident from different angles. The Commission has signaled synergy here – information from CRA notifications (via ENISA) can inform NIS2 entities and vice versa ([Re: [open-regulatory-compliance] Does being categorized as Important or](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/open-regulatory-compliance/msg00158.html#:~:text=products%20that%20are%20purely%20digital%3F,contributing%20to%20the%20relevant%20software)). Another overlap: **Supply chain security** – NIS2 obliges essential entities to use secure products and address supplier risks, effectively pushing them to procure CRA-compliant products once the CRA is in force. Because of this, *“Member States should ensure that CRA requirements are considered in procurement by entities under NIS2”* ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=which%20must%20comply%20with%20the,manufacturers%E2%80%99%20ability%20to%20effectively%20apply)). In summary, CRA and NIS2 form a continuum: CRA hardens the tech products; NIS2 ensures critical users of tech manage their systems securely. Together, they significantly raise cybersecurity resilience in Europe.

- **EU Cybersecurity Act (2019/881) – Certification Framework:** The Cybersecurity Act established a voluntary European framework for cybersecurity **certification schemes** of ICT products. The CRA leverages this by potentially making certain certifications **mandatory**. As noted, “critical” products under CRA will need certification at *“substantial”* or *“high”* assurance level ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=a%C2%A0category%20of%20critical%20products%20with,the%20level%20of%20cybersecurity%20risk)). For example, a smart meter gateway or a hardware security module may need to undergo the EU Common Criteria-based certification. If a relevant **European certification scheme** exists (such as EUCC or EU Secure Cloud), obtaining a certificate under that scheme can be used to demonstrate compliance with CRA for those aspects ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=To%20the%20extent%20that%20their,a%C2%A0European%20cybersecurity%20certification%20scheme%20established)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=facilitate%20compliance%2C%20wallet%20providers%20should,parts%20thereof%2C%20covers%20those%20requirements)). The interplay is such that **CRA can drive the uptake of cybersecurity certification** – what was voluntary becomes de facto required for certain high-risk products. Additionally, the CRA empowers the Commission to propose new certification schemes if needed to cover future critical product categories ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=such%20categories%20of%20product%2C%20by,certification%20where%20a%C2%A0relevant%20European%20cybersecurity)) ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=critical%20products%20with%20digital%20elements,be%20required%20to%20obtain%20a%C2%A0European)). Companies making products in those categories will have to navigate both CRA conformity and certification requirements (ideally they align, so one process satisfies both). Essentially, **CRA provides the legal mandate, and the Cybersecurity Act provides the tools (certification) to verify high security**.

- **AI Act (Proposed Regulation on Artificial Intelligence):** The AI Act (still in legislative process) will regulate AI systems, especially “high-risk AI systems,” imposing requirements like risk management, transparency, and robustness, including **resilience against manipulation** (Article 15 of the AI Act proposal addresses AI system security). The CRA and AI Act can overlap if an AI system is delivered as a product with digital elements. For instance, an AI-driven IoT device or an AI software platform might be subject to both laws – CRA for general product security, AI Act for specific AI concerns (like accuracy, bias, and some security). The draft AI Act explicitly references cybersecurity: high-risk AI providers must ensure their AI is secure from tampering and data poisoning. To avoid double regulation, the CRA states that if a high-risk AI system **meets the CRA’s essential cybersecurity requirements, it is deemed to comply with the AI Act’s security requirements** ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=comply%20with%20the%20essential%20cybersecurity,EU)). This means fulfilling CRA’s standards on secure design will satisfy the AI Act’s overlap in security, preventing contradictory requirements. Still, AI products will have additional obligations (like on data sets, documentation) from the AI Act beyond CRA’s scope. Companies in AI must be mindful of both: CRA covering the technical IT security of the product, and AI Act covering algorithmic and ethical risks. They will need to incorporate both sets in their design process.

- **Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA):** DORA is an EU regulation specifically for the **financial sector’s ICT risk** (entered into force in 2023). It requires banks, fintechs, insurers, etc., to have strong IT risk management, incident reporting (to financial supervisors), and oversight of third-party ICT providers. While DORA isn’t explicitly named in the question, for financial institutions (an audience for this report) it’s highly relevant. **DORA and CRA** intersect in the domain of ICT supply chain: a bank under DORA must ensure the technology they use (including hardware/software) is secure and meets certain standards. Once CRA is in effect, banks will likely prefer or even be required (by regulators’ guidance) to use CRA-compliant products as part of meeting their DORA obligations on ICT procurement. Also, if a bank develops its own software product used by customers, CRA might categorize the bank as a “manufacturer,” meaning the bank has to follow CRA for that app *and* follow DORA for its operations. Fortunately, the objectives align: DORA emphasizes resilience and testing, CRA ensures baseline security in products – together they reduce systemic cyber risk in finance. Financial institutions will coordinate compliance efforts, e.g., mapping CRA requirements for any in-house developed customer-facing tools to their overall DORA compliance program.

- **Product Liability and Consumer Protection Laws:** The CRA indirectly ties into product liability – by establishing what “defective” means in terms of cybersecurity. The EU is also updating its Product Liability Directive to clarify that if a product has insufficient cybersecurity (e.g., lacks required updates), it could be considered defective, making the manufacturer liable for damages. Thus, non-compliance with CRA not only risks regulatory fines but also private litigation. Consumer protection laws (like the Sale of Goods Directive) imply that products should match the quality and safety standards expected – CRA sets those expectations for security. So post-2027, selling a product that doesn’t meet CRA could also violate consumer law (goods not in conformity with contract if they pose security risks). Businesses need to appreciate this legal ecosystem where CRA compliance is more than just avoiding fines; it’s essential to avoid civil liability and reputational harm.

In summary, the CRA has been crafted to **fit neatly into the EU’s regulatory puzzle**: it closes a gap by covering product security horizontally. GDPR covers data, NIS2 covers services and critical operators, DORA covers finance sector IT, AI Act covers AI systems – and CRA provides the foundation that the *products and devices* used under all those laws are cybersecure. Companies should ensure their compliance efforts are coordinated. For example, a tech firm can map CRA’s requirements to its GDPR security measures and NIS2 obligations (if applicable), creating efficiencies. Notably, **no clause in CRA overrides other laws’ requirements** – all apply in parallel. If anything, compliance with one makes compliance with the others easier: a secure product (CRA) is less likely to cause a personal data breach (GDPR) or an incident at a critical service (NIS2). EU policymakers and agencies (like ENISA and data protection authorities) will likely issue guidance on navigating these overlaps. As of now, the key is to **identify all regulatory regimes that apply to your business and products**, and ensure solutions are designed to satisfy the strictest applicable standard among them.

## 5. Market Impact and Global Reach of the CRA

The Cyber Resilience Act is set to have profound impacts on both the European market and international companies that sell into Europe:

**Impact on EU Companies:** EU-based manufacturers of digital products will need to **integrate cybersecurity into product development at a level that may be new for some,** incurring compliance costs but also gaining a competitive edge in product trust. The CRA essentially raises the *minimum bar* – companies that already follow strong security practices will find the transition easier (they might just formalize existing processes), whereas companies that have ignored security will face a significant shift (e.g., many smaller IoT gadget makers may need to invest in security engineering for the first time). In the EU single market, the CRA will harmonize requirements, meaning **no more divergent national cybersecurity certification schemes** for products. This regulatory uniformity can actually benefit businesses by providing one clear standard across 27 countries ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=lex,can%20take%20to%20ensure%20compliance)). Products compliant with CRA can circulate EU-wide with the CE mark, reducing fragmentation.

**Impact on International Companies:** Non-EU companies are equally affected if they wish to access the EU’s 450+ million consumer market. The **“marketplace principle”** means a company in the US, China, Japan, etc., must ensure its products meet CRA requirements when selling in Europe ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20the%20territorial,the%20CRA%20is%20in%20effect)). This could mean redesigning products, implementing new update policies, or packaging differently (with CE mark and EU docs). Many large global tech firms (software vendors, cloud service appliance providers, electronics giants) will likely choose to **adopt CRA standards globally** for simplicity, rather than creating an “EU-only” secure version. This mirrors what happened with GDPR – many companies extended GDPR’s privacy protections worldwide. By driving up standards in the EU, the CRA may become a **de facto global benchmark for product cybersecurity**. Countries and regions may also follow suit: for instance, the UK is working on its Product Security and Telecommunications Infrastructure (PSTI) law (with similar IoT security requirements), and the U.S. has introduced IoT cybersecurity guidelines and labeling programs. The CRA could push these efforts further, possibly leading to mutual recognition or at least alignment of standards internationally.

**Market Access and Costs:** There is a risk that some companies, especially smaller foreign manufacturers, might decide **not to enter the EU market** due to compliance costs (similar to how some websites blocked EU users after GDPR). However, given the size and economic power of the EU, most serious vendors will attempt to comply rather than lose access. Those that do invest in compliance may use it as a **marketing advantage** (“EU CE cybersecurity certified” could become a selling point even outside Europe, signifying quality). Conversely, products that are not secure enough will effectively be barred – EU customs and market surveillance can prevent the import or sale of non-compliant devices. This may reduce the influx of cheap, insecure IoT gadgets (often imported from overseas), thus **levelling the playing field** for companies who invest in security.

**Supply Chain Effects:** The CRA’s influence will ripple through supply chains. Manufacturers will demand that their **suppliers of software and components also follow secure practices**, since the final product’s compliance depends on each part. For instance, if a European IoT company uses a Wi-Fi module from a third party, it will insist that module has no known vulnerabilities and gets updates, to fulfill CRA obligations. We may see contractual requirements and vetting processes tighten up. Non-EU suppliers that want to continue selling components to EU device makers may also need to adhere to CRA principles. This could globally raise security in components (chips, modules, open-source libraries). Additionally, the **importer role** means that EU-based importers of foreign products will shoulder responsibility – they might require assurances or certifications from the foreign manufacturer. If a foreign company lacks an EU presence, an importer might be hesitant to take on a product that could be non-compliant (because the importer can be penalized). So foreign companies may establish EU reps or subsidiaries to handle CRA compliance and reduce friction for distributors.

**Innovation and Competitiveness:** By mandating security, the CRA could spur innovation in cybersecurity solutions (like new secure-by-design tools, testing services, etc.). Some critics worry it might burden innovation by adding compliance bureaucracy, especially for startups. However, the **phased timeline** (3 years lead time, see Section 7) gives companies time to adapt in their R&D cycles. In the long run, products that are secure are more sustainable and trusted, which is crucial for things like IoT adoption. The CRA can increase **consumer confidence** in connected products (knowing a CE mark now also covers cybersecurity). This could actually expand the market for digital products, as security-concerned customers (including businesses) are more willing to deploy IoT and software widely when they have regulatory assurance of baseline security ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=consumers%20and%20businesses%20currently%20face,with%20the%20proper%20cybersecurity%20features)) ([Cyber Resilience Act | Shaping Europe’s digital future](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/cyber-resilience-act#:~:text=The%20CRA%20introduces%20mandatory%20cybersecurity,sold%20in%20the%20EU%20market)).

**Global Alignment:** Outside the EU, regulators are watching. We might see regulatory *convergence*: e.g., **the EU CRA and US efforts** (such as NIST’s IoT cybersecurity guidelines and the White House’s IoT labeling program) share similar goals (unique device passwords, vulnerability disclosure, etc.). While the legal approaches differ, over time manufacturers might push for international standards that satisfy multiple regions at once. There could be international standardization (ISO/IEC) of baseline IoT security that the CRA will adopt via harmonized standards – making it easier for non-EU companies that already follow ISO standards to claim compliance. Trade implications are also possible: compliant products may become a requirement in procurement and trade deals.

In short, the CRA is likely to **elevate global cybersecurity norms for products**. EU companies must treat it as a strategic requirement – part of product quality – and not just a legal checkbox. Non-EU companies must integrate CRA compliance into their product development or risk losing EU market access. The **initial cost** (more secure components, new testing, documentation efforts, possibly third-party certifications) is an investment that can pay off by reducing cyber incidents (and associated costs) and by enhancing brand reputation for security. Organizations that proactively adapt could gain first-mover advantage in the new regulatory environment.

For industries like finance and healthcare that heavily rely on ICT products, CRA-compliant products will likely become the preferred choice, possibly even mandated by those industries’ regulators. Thus, tech providers to those sectors (like core banking software, fintech devices, medical software) will need CRA compliance not just for EU law, but to satisfy their clients’ requirements.

## 6. Practical Implications for Businesses (Tech, IoT, Financial Sectors)

The CRA will affect different industries in distinct ways. Here we provide sector-specific guidance and strategies:

### **6.1 Tech Companies (Software Developers & IT Firms)**

For traditional tech companies – including software publishers, SaaS providers, enterprise IT solution vendors, and cloud service product vendors – the CRA means **embedding security and compliance into the software development lifecycle**:

- **Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC):** Companies should incorporate CRA requirements into each phase of development. This includes performing threat modeling for new software products, adopting coding standards that prevent common vulnerabilities, using automated security testing (see Section 7 on AI tools), and conducting regular code reviews and penetration tests. Many software firms already follow OWASP or other frameworks; these now become essential to evidence “secure by design” compliance.

- **Risk Assessment for Software Releases:** Every major software release should be preceded by a documented risk assessment ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,cannot%20be%20shorter%20than%2010)). For example, a company releasing a mobile app or an enterprise software should analyze how an attacker might abuse it, what data it handles, etc., and ensure those risks are mitigated. If the software relies on backend cloud APIs (remote processing), ensure those endpoints are secured too, as CRA treats them as part of the product ([Regulation - 2024/2847 - EN - EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32024R2847#:~:text=a%C2%A0product%20with%20digital%20elements%20to,In%20such%20a%C2%A0case%2C%20the%20service)).

- **Vulnerability Management Program:** Tech companies must have a robust process to handle vulnerabilities post-release. This means setting up or enhancing a **PSIRT (Product Security Incident Response Team)** function. Key actions are establishing a public channel for vulnerability reports (e.g., <security@example.com> or web form), committing to quick analysis and patch development, and communicating transparently with users. Many software firms might formalize a **bug bounty program or responsible disclosure policy** to incentivize external reports. Ensure an internal database (or use an industry database) to track all known issues and their resolution status.

- **Regular Updates & Patching:** If you offer on-premise software, you’ll need to issue security patches and updates regularly. CRA mandates free updates for security issues, so software license or support agreements should reflect that security fixes are provided at no cost. For cloud or SaaS offerings (which might be considered a “product” if delivered to users), ensure that the service is continuously updated behind the scenes to fix vulnerabilities swiftly. While CRA might not directly regulate pure “services”, if your SaaS includes client software or devices, those are in scope. Moreover, SaaS vendors should note NIS2 might cover them if they’re critical providers; aligning with CRA is prudent.

- **User Guidance and Hardening:** Provide clear admin guides or user manuals focusing on security. For software products, that means documentation on secure configuration (e.g., if your software is deployed in a customer’s environment, give guidelines for secure setup, least privilege, etc.). If your product requires integration or enabling certain features for security (like enabling 2FA, or TLS encryption), highlight those as default or recommended in documentation. Make it easy for users to do the right thing security-wise, and warn them of risks if they don’t.

- **Cloud/IT Service Providers:** If you’re delivering hardware appliances or software to enterprises (for example, a security appliance or network tool), those are clearly under CRA. But if you’re a purely cloud service (no delivered product), you might not be directly under CRA but under NIS2 (if essential/important entity). However, any **agent software or on-premise component** you provide to clients is under CRA. For instance, a cybersecurity company providing an endpoint agent has to make that agent CRA-compliant. Tech companies should inventory all “products” they deliver – including free tools, mobile apps connected to services, SDKs – all count if given to users.

- **Quality Assurance and Standards:** Align your development and QA processes with known standards that map to CRA. Following **ISO/IEC 27034 (application security), ISO 62304 (for medical software) or other secure dev standards** can help demonstrate due diligence. Adopting **DevSecOps** practices – integrating security checks into CI/CD pipelines – will help catch issues early and frequently, which is cost-effective compliance.

- **Penetration Testing & Red-Teaming:** Regular pentests of products (especially before major releases) will be important to ensure no known vulns. CRA doesn’t explicitly mandate pentesting, but having an independent security assessment will provide evidence that you sought out vulnerabilities (and fixed them). This is particularly important for higher-risk software (like those in Annex III important category – e.g., identity management software should undergo rigorous testing).

- **Documentation & Record-Keeping:** Tech firms must maintain technical documentation (design specs, security architecture, test results) for each product version. While this sounds bureaucratic, it can be built into the development workflow – e.g., require engineers to update a security design document, and archive test results automatically. This will pay off if a regulator asks for proof of compliance. Use version control not just for code, but for documentation of compliance measures.

- **Authorized EU Representative:** Non-EU tech companies (say a US software company) should appoint an EU representative for CRA, or ensure an EU subsidiary takes responsibility. This entity would keep documentation and liaise with EU authorities if needed. Many software companies that went through GDPR will have Data Protection Representatives; similarly, set up a **CRA compliance contact in the EU**.

For tech companies, CRA compliance can overlap with existing cybersecurity best practices. Many may find they are partway there if they’ve been diligent about product security. The key new aspects are **formalizing the processes (risk assessments, having written policies)** and meeting the strict timelines for reporting and patching.

### **6.2 IoT and Device Manufacturers**

IoT makers (smart device companies, industrial sensor manufacturers, consumer electronics firms) may face the biggest adjustments, as this sector has historically had variable security maturity. Key steps for IoT businesses:

- **Secure Hardware Design:** Incorporate hardware-based security features early. Use secure elements or TPM chips for device identity and crypto operations if appropriate (especially if your device handles sensitive operations – might even be necessary for “critical” class devices like security tokens). Ensure the bootloader is secure (verified boot to prevent unauthorized firmware). CRA’s requirements on integrity and access control mean that features like secure boot, hardware random number generators, and physical tamper resistance (for critical devices) should be considered.

- **No Default Passwords:** Ensure **unique credentials per device or an onboarding mechanism for credentials**. The era of shipping all devices with “admin/admin” is over (and was already discouraged by ENISA and national schemes). CRA will essentially enforce the UK’s guideline of unique passwords for IoT. Implement a user-friendly setup that requires the customer to set a password or use an app-based onboarding that provisions creds securely.

- **Minimal Open Services:** By default, disable debug interfaces (UART, JTAG) in production units or secure them. Close all unnecessary network ports. If the device only needs to talk to a cloud server, ensure it doesn’t also run extraneous services. This satisfies attack surface minimization ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=,potential%20entry%20points%20for%20cyberattacks)). Use firewall rules on the device if applicable to restrict inbound access.

- **Resource Constraints & DoS:** Ensure your IoT device can handle network noise safely. For example, have reasonable input validation to avoid crashes from malformed packets (availability protection). If device resources are limited, consider graceful denial (e.g., if overwhelmed by requests, it should fail safely or reboot rather than be permanently compromised). This ties to the **availability and resilience** requirement ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act - What You Need to Know | A&O Shearman - JDSupra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-what-you-3657173/#:~:text=intended%20purpose%20of%20a%20PDE%3B,attack%20surface%20limitation%20to%20minimise)).

- **Secure Update Mechanism:** This is **critical for IoT**. Implement a robust OTA (Over-the-Air) update system that delivers signed updates. The update process should itself be secure against man-in-the-middle or corrupted updates. Also, consider how often you can realistically push updates – you might need to improve infrastructure to deliver patches to potentially millions of devices reliably. Plan for updates to be differential or small for bandwidth, but no matter what, *committing to 5+ years of updates* means ensuring you have the engineering capacity and cloud infrastructure for long-term support.

- **Monitoring and Telemetry:** IoT firms should consider building in some telemetry (while respecting privacy) to detect anomalies. For example, devices could report version info to a cloud service so you know how many are outdated. Or if feasible, detect certain attacks (maybe via logs or behavior) and alert the manufacturer. While not explicitly required by CRA, such telemetry can help you meet the incident reporting duty (you might become aware of exploits faster through device feedback). Ensure any telemetry or logging doesn’t violate user privacy or GDPR – keep it strictly technical where possible.

- **User Communication:** IoT manufacturers often have consumers as customers, so think about **how you will communicate security notices**. If an issue arises, do you have user email contacts (maybe via product registration or mobile app pairing)? If not, consider encouraging users to register devices or pushing critical notifications through companion apps or websites. For professional IoT (industrial), maintain client contact lists to send security advisories.

- **Labeling and Trust Marks:** In addition to CE marking, consider using the upcoming EU cybersecurity label (if one emerges from CRA or related initiatives) to signal compliance. Some countries have voluntary labels (Finland’s Cybersecurity Label, etc.), but CRA might make those redundant. Still, marketing that your device meets CRA standards can reassure retailers and consumers. Retailers in EU might eventually require CRA compliance proofs from suppliers to avoid stocking non-compliant goods.

- **Impact on Product Design Cycle:** IoT companies often have fast product cycles. With CRA, you need to incorporate a **security checkpoint in each cycle**. For example, before finalizing hardware, do a security review of the design; before locking software, run vulnerability scans. Also budget time for potentially an external assessment if your product is in an important category – that can add few weeks or months to timeline to get a Notified Body review or certification. So product managers must account for that in go-to-market planning.

- **Cost Management:** For SMEs making IoT gadgets, compliance costs can be a concern. To minimize costs: adopt existing **standards and platforms**. For example, leverage an IoT platform that provides secure update and device management out-of-the-box instead of building your own. Use open-source solutions that are known for security (but keep them updated!). Participate in industry consortia to share best practices. The one-time effort to set up a secure development pipeline will pay off across all products. The CRA’s harmonized standards (once published) will likely be very helpful checklists – following them can streamline compliance (and also reduce the risk of costly recalls or fines).

- **Warranty and Support Adjustments:** IoT firms may need to change how they handle product end-of-life. If you currently only offer 2-year warranties or support, now you must extend security support to 5 years minimum. This doesn’t mean full warranty replacement, but it does mean keeping update servers running and engineers available to produce patches for older models. Budgeting for this extended support (perhaps via maintenance contracts or by including it in product cost) is necessary. Some companies might introduce subscription models for value-added services but **cannot charge for security updates** – those have to be free ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=document%20vulnerabilities%20and%20components%20contained,level%20dependencies%20of%20the%20product)). However, offering premium support beyond the mandated period could be a model (e.g., after 5 years, offer extended support for industrial clients at a cost, while consumer devices might simply state end-of-support).

In summary, IoT makers should treat security as a core feature now. Many steps like eliminating default passwords, secure OTA updates, and encryption were recommended by guidelines before; with CRA they become legally required. Early adopters of these practices will find themselves ahead, while others may face a steep learning curve. Engaging with ENISA’s guidance and sector-specific security frameworks (like ETSI EN 303 645 for consumer IoT) is a good starting point to align with CRA requirements.

### **6.3 Financial Institutions (Banks, FinTech, Insurance)**

Financial institutions typically are users/consumers of technology rather than manufacturers, but many develop or heavily customize software for their customers (like mobile banking apps, payment systems) and operate extensive IT environments. The CRA’s implications for this sector include:

- **If the institution is a “manufacturer”:** Banks and fintechs should determine if any of their IT offerings qualify as products under CRA. For instance, a bank providing a mobile banking app to customers – is that a “product with digital elements placed on the market”? It’s offered to customers (even if free as part of service). Likely yes, it is considered a product (software) made available in the EU, thus the bank in this context is a manufacturer under CRA’s definition ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=In%20order%20for%20the%20CRA,further%20examples%20of%20commercial%20activities)) (supplying a product for use in the EU as part of a commercial activity, even if no direct price). Similarly, if a bank issues a physical device to customers (say a security token or smartcard reader), that device and its software are in scope. Therefore, financial institutions must **apply CRA principles to in-house developed customer-facing tech**. This means their development teams for mobile apps, internet banking platforms, etc., should follow the secure development guidelines described above for tech companies (risk assessments, secure by design, vulnerability handling).

- **DORA and CRA Alignment:** Financial entities are regulated under DORA (Digital Operational Resilience Act) from January 2025 onward, which requires stringent ICT risk management. CRA complements this by focusing on products. A bank should incorporate CRA compliance checks in its **vendor procurement and management process**. When buying new software or hardware, banks should request evidence or certification of CRA compliance (after 2027, any CE-marked digital product should inherently be CRA-compliant). For existing inventory, banks might start phasing out products that are unlikely to meet CRA standards in the future for security reasons. Also, banks could update contracts with critical IT suppliers to require adherence to CRA requirements and incident notification from vendors (which might overlap with DORA’s requirement for contractual clauses with third-party providers).

- **Incident Reporting Coordination:** Under DORA, a bank must report major incidents to financial supervisors; under CRA, a manufacturer must report product incidents to CSIRTs/ENISA. If a bank’s own product (e.g., banking app) is exploited, the bank might end up both as a CRA reporter (as manufacturer of the app) and as a DORA reporter (as an entity suffering an operational incident). They should set up internal processes to ensure both obligations are met without confusion. Likely, the bank’s risk/CISO team will handle DORA reports, while a product security team handles CRA; these teams should communicate. It may be efficient to consolidate the reporting workflow: if an incident meets both criteria, prepare one report that can feed to both channels with necessary info for each.

- **Customer Trust and Liability:** Banks have a duty of care for secure services. CRA compliance for any customer-facing tech can be seen as part of that duty. If a bank’s app caused customers to lose money due to a known vulnerability, the bank could face liability. Ensuring CRA compliance reduces that risk. Also, banks can reassure customers (and regulators) that their digital channels meet state-of-art security standards. Possibly, marketing or annual reports could mention compliance to bolster trust (though be careful to not treat it as a differentiator since it’s mandatory for all).

- **Collaborating with Tech Providers:** Many financial institutions rely on software from vendors (core banking systems, trading platforms, etc.). Those vendors will have to be CRA-compliant if they sell in EU. Financial institutions should open dialogue with key vendors now: **ask them how they plan to meet CRA**. This early engagement helps both sides – the vendor may offer assurances or updates, and the bank can plan updates or migrations. For bespoke software developed by third parties for the bank, clarify if it’s considered “placed on the market” (possibly not if exclusively developed for one customer). If not on market, CRA might not directly apply, but the bank should still demand the software meets CRA-equivalent standards as a best practice, given the high security expectations in finance.

- **Internal IoT/IT Use:** Banks also use IoT or IT devices internally (CCTV, smart building systems, ATM machines, etc.). While the bank isn’t the manufacturer, as a user they should be aware if these products are CRA-compliant. Post-2027, banks might update internal security policies to prefer CRA-certified devices for any new procurement (for example, only buy CE-marked IoT sensors that comply, which they would by law after 2027). This reduces the bank’s internal risk and aligns with NIS2 which will classify many banks as essential entities required to manage supply chain cybersecurity.

- **Cost Management for Compliance:** Large financial institutions likely have the resources (security teams, compliance officers) to manage CRA-related tasks, especially since they overlap with existing programs (many banks already run secure dev for apps, have bug bounty programs, etc.). For smaller financial institutions or fintech startups, CRA could be a new burden if they produce an app or device. Fintech startups should bake security in from day one, leveraging cloud services that are secure and libraries that are well-maintained, to minimize cost. Also, consider partnerships – e.g., use banking-as-a-service platforms that handle a lot of the heavy IT lifting securely, so your fintech product has fewer points of potential non-compliance.

- **Examples:** *Case study:* A European bank’s mobile app is developed in-house. To comply with CRA, the bank conducts a threat analysis of the app, ensures all API communications are encrypted and authenticated (satisfying confidentiality/integrity requirements), removes any unused code libraries, implements certificate pinning, etc. They set up a vulnerability disclosure page on their website inviting researchers to report issues, and commit to patching any critical bug within say 30 days. They also integrate an automated security scan into each app update pipeline. When the CRA takes effect, they register as the “manufacturer” of the app with their national authority and ensure all documentation (design, risk assessment, etc.) is ready. When they release the app, they publish a conformity declaration (perhaps on their website) stating it meets CRA requirements. In the app’s “About” or help section, they include info on the security support period (e.g., “This app version will receive security updates until 2029”) and instructions for users on enabling auto-update and using the app securely (like not using rooted phones, etc.). This approach not only meets CRA, but gives the bank’s customers confidence in the app’s security, potentially reducing fraudulent incidents.

In essence, **financial institutions should view CRA not as an isolated compliance task, but as part of their holistic cyber resilience efforts (aligned with DORA, PSD2 security, etc.)**. It helps them ensure that the products they build or buy are not the weakest link in their security chain.

### **6.4 Best Practices to Minimize Compliance Costs (SMEs vs. Large Enterprises)**

**For SMEs (Small/Medium Enterprises):** Smaller companies might lack dedicated compliance teams, so efficiency is key:

- **Leverage Existing Security Standards:** Use known standards or frameworks (ISO 27001, ETSI EN 303 645 for IoT, CIS benchmarks, etc.) as a blueprint. Often these map closely to CRA requirements ([](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2024-11/Cyber%20Resilience%20Act%20Requirements%20Standards%20Mapping%20-%20final_with_identifiers_0.pdf#:~:text=%E2%80%94%20Product%20cybersecurity%20requirements%20in,a%20standardisation%20process%20by%20the)). Implementing such standards can simultaneously improve security and achieve compliance with less guesswork. For example, ETSI EN 303 645 covers no default passwords, vulnerability disclosure, and other items that line up with CRA’s essentials.

- **Use Open-Source and Managed Services Wisely:** While open-source components are not directly regulated unless commercialized, if you use them in your product, ensure you choose widely used, actively maintained ones. This reduces known vulnerabilities and provides quicker fixes. Consider using managed services or libraries that automatically update (for example, if building on a platform like Firebase or AWS IoT, the underlying security is partly managed by a big provider). This can outsource some security heavy lifting. Just ensure you still do your part in configuration and applying patches provided by those platforms.

- **Community and Industry Groups:** Participate in industry associations or working groups focusing on CRA compliance. For instance, manufacturers of a certain IoT type might share best practices in an alliance. ENISA and the European Commission may also publish guidance specifically for SMEs to implement CRA – keep an eye on those resources. Collaboration can spread the cost (e.g., developing a common open-source library for secure updates that many companies can use).

- **Automate Testing:** SMEs should invest in a few **automated security tools** (many are affordable or even open source) – e.g., static code analyzers, dependency vulnerability scanners (like GitHub Dependabot, OWASP Dependency Check), and network scanners. Automation catches low-hanging issues without needing a full security team, thereby saving cost of later firefights or fines.

- **Focus on High-Risk Aspects:** Do a mini risk ranking of your product’s features. Allocate more security effort to the parts of the product that handle sensitive data or have internet exposure, to maximize risk reduction with limited resources. CRA requires appropriate security relative to risk ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Products%20with%20digital%20elements%20will,cybersecurity%20based%20on%20the%20risks)). Regulators will likely be understanding if a tiny feature has a minor issue that poses negligible risk, but not if a major weakness exists in a critical function.

- **Consider External Certifications or Audits:** While costly, getting an external security certification (like ISO 27001 for your processes, or IEC 62443 for industrial components) can streamline compliance and market acceptance. It might also reduce insurance costs or attract clients. There may be EU or national grants to help SMEs with cybersecurity improvements – those are worth exploring to offset costs.

**For Large Enterprises:** Larger companies often have more complex product lines and more resources:

- **Integrate CRA Compliance into Corporate Governance:** Treat CRA as you treat quality or safety. Establish a governance structure (e.g., a compliance manager for product security) that oversees all product teams. They can develop internal policies and checklists aligning with CRA, so each team doesn’t reinvent the wheel. Regular internal audits or reviews of products for CRA compliance can catch issues early.

- **Economies of Scale in Tooling:** Large firms can invest in enterprise-grade tooling (for example, advanced threat modeling tools, CI/CD security integration, centralized logging for all products). Once set up, these tools provide company-wide benefits. For instance, a central SBOM repository for all products can be managed by one team and used by all development teams to track components and vulnerabilities.

- **Training Programs:** Scale allows for comprehensive training. Provide secure coding and CRA compliance training to developers, product managers, and support staff. Ensure everyone understands their role (developers write secure code, product managers plan for long-term support, support teams know how to handle vulnerability reports, etc.). With hundreds of staff, a train-the-trainer model might work, or using e-learning modules. Well-trained staff reduce mistakes that lead to vulnerabilities.

- **Dedicated Incident Response:** Big enterprises can afford dedicated incident response teams and threat intelligence. Leverage that to feed into product security – if your SOC (Security Operations Center) finds a new threat tactic, have them inform product teams to harden against it. Also, large firms can run **bug bounty programs** at scale to get continuous external testing on their products, which can find issues cheaper than hiring dozens more internal testers.

- **Supply Chain Pressure:** Large companies have leverage over suppliers. They can require CRA compliance from third-party components/providers contractually (which also helps them if an authority questions a component, they can show they demanded compliance). They can also work jointly with key suppliers to fix any gaps (e.g., co-testing a supplier’s module for vulnerabilities).

- **Phased Rollout:** If you have many products, prioritize compliance efforts for them by risk and market importance. Possibly adopt a phased approach (somewhat like how one might phase ISO 9001 quality certification by product line). Focus on high-impact or high-risk products first (especially those in “important” categories like security software or critical infrastructure equipment). Learn from those and gradually apply to lower-risk products. The 3-year window allows for a staggered approach.

- **Avoiding Duplication:** Many large firms operate globally and face multiple standards (like US FDA cybersecurity for medical devices, etc.). Use integrated compliance strategies. If you have compliance for one regime, map it to CRA to cover both with one set of controls. For example, if you comply with FDA premarket cybersecurity for a device, much of that evidence can be reused for CRA documentation since they share common ideas (SBOM, threat modeling, etc.). Unifying compliance efforts prevents doing the same work twice under different banners.

**Cost-Benefit Outlook:** Both SMEs and large enterprises should recognize that **the cost of strong security is an investment**. It prevents costly incidents (which can far exceed compliance costs in damage). The CRA essentially forces a cost now to avoid bigger costs later. By minimizing duplication of effort and using smart tools, businesses can control expenses. Additionally, **AI and automation (discussed next) can significantly reduce manual labor costs** in compliance by handling repetitive tasks like scanning and monitoring at scale ([How will rules and regulations affect cybersecurity and AI in 2025? | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/feature/how-will-rules-and-regulations-affect-cybersecurity-and-ai-in-2025#:~:text=As%20frameworks%20like%20FedRAMP%20and,identify%20risks%20and%20cut%20costs)).

Finally, no matter the size, companies might consider **insurance for cyber and product liability**. Insurers will likely look favorably on CRA compliance as a sign of reduced risk, possibly lowering premiums. Conversely, after CRA’s applicability, failure to comply (and then suffering a breach) might even invalidate certain insurance claims. So demonstrating compliance has financial benefits beyond just avoiding fines – it can strengthen an organization’s overall risk posture and financial resilience.

## 7. Phased Approach to Compliance Using AI & Automation

Achieving CRA compliance is a multi-step journey. Businesses should start early and proceed in phases, leveraging automation and AI tools wherever possible to increase efficiency. Below is a **step-by-step roadmap** with integrated AI/automation recommendations:

### Phase 1: Preparation and Inventory (Months 0-3)

1. **Awareness and Task Force:** Immediately designate a **CRA compliance lead or team**. Ensure executive buy-in by explaining the CRA’s importance and deadlines (remember that main obligations kick in by Dec 2027, but some like incident reporting by Sept 2026 ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=applicability%20will%20commence%20after%20a,products%20from%2011%20September%202026))). This team will coordinate efforts across departments (R&D, IT, legal, etc.).  
2. **Product Inventory & Applicability Assessment:** Catalog all products, software, and devices your company offers or uses, and identify which are in scope ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=1,economic%20operator%20under%20the%20CRA)). Note each product’s type, version, and whether you are manufacturer, importer, or user. *Automation tip:* Use an asset management tool or CMDB to help gather this list. If you have many software applications, scripts can query repositories or databases for a list of deliverables.
3. **Economic Operator Role Check:** For each product, determine your role – manufacturer (developed by you under your name), importer (bringing someone else’s product to EU), or distributor. If you rely on third-party components heavily, identify those suppliers (they might need to be looped in).

### Phase 2: Risk Classification and Gap Analysis (Months 3-6)

4. **Classify Products by CRA Category:** Using Annex III & IV lists, classify each product as *non-critical, important (Class I/II), or critical* ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=The%20set%20of%20CRA%20obligations,products%20on%20the%20EU%20market)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Critical)). This will tell you the level of conformity assessment needed. For example, if you make “smart toys,” those are listed as important (Class I) ([What to know about the EU Cyber Resilience Act  | IAPP](https://iapp.org/news/a/what-to-know-about-the-eu-cybersecurity-resilience-act#:~:text=Annex%20III%20of%20the%20CRA,be%20amended%20by%20the%20European)) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Identity%20management%20systems%20and%20hardware%2C,Annex%20III%20CRA)); network firewalls would be important (Class II) ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=General%20%2B%20additional%20requirements%20%28Art,6%20and%207%20CRA)); a crypto security token might be critical ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=General%20%2B%20additional%20requirements%20%28Art,6%20and%208%20CRA)). Most others will be non-critical.  
5. **Compliance Gap Analysis:** For each product (or product line), perform a **gap analysis** against CRA requirements ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=3,gaps%20for%20the%20relevant%20products)). Compare your current security features and processes with the essential requirements (Section 3.1 above) and vulnerability handling requirements (3.2). Identify gaps. For example, you might find: product X has a default password (gap: violates secure-by-default), product Y has no formal update policy (gap: need defined support period), product Z’s documentation lacks a security guide (gap: documentation needs update). Also check your internal processes: do you have a channel for vulnerability disclosure? Incident response plan? If not, mark those as gaps to address.  
   *Automation tip:* Use checklists or tools: Some organizations are creating **CRA compliance checklists** mapping each requirement to checks. You can use a GRC (Governance, Risk, Compliance) tool or spreadsheet to track each requirement and mark compliant/non-compliant for each product. AI can assist by parsing product documentation or code to flag potential gaps – e.g., an AI code analysis might detect hardcoded credentials or weak encryption usage automatically, signaling a compliance issue (this is an example of “compliance as code” concept ([How will rules and regulations affect cybersecurity and AI in 2025? | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/feature/how-will-rules-and-regulations-affect-cybersecurity-and-ai-in-2025#:~:text=As%20frameworks%20like%20FedRAMP%20and,identify%20risks%20and%20cut%20costs))).

6. **Prioritize Gaps by Risk and Effort:** Not all gaps are equal. Prioritize fixes that address high security risks or are fundamental for compliance (e.g., eliminating known vulnerabilities, implementing an update mechanism) over those that are more procedural (like improving documentation wording). This prioritization ensures you tackle the most critical issues first. AI tools can help simulate risk impact – for instance, using threat modeling software (some of which use AI to suggest threats) to see which vulnerabilities could be most severe.

### Phase 3: Planning and Resource Allocation (Months 6-9)

7. **Action Plan Development:** Convert gap analysis findings into a concrete **action plan** ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=4,for%20implementation%20of%20actions%20items)). For each needed change, define tasks, responsible owners, and deadlines. E.g., “Implement secure boot in firmware by Q2 2026, Responsible: Firmware Team”, “Create user security guide for product X by Q4 2025, Responsible: Tech Writer”. Ensure to align deadlines with CRA’s enforcement dates – some tasks (like setting up reporting processes) must be done by mid-2026 to meet the 21-month deadline ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=Certain%20provisions%20on%20the%20notification,products%20from%2011%20September%202026)), others by end of 2027.  
8. **Allocate Resources:** Determine budget and personnel needs. Some actions may require new hires (e.g., a security engineer or compliance officer), external consultants (for training or auditing), or tools purchase. Justify these by highlighting the risk of non-compliance costs. Many companies will integrate these needs into their upcoming fiscal budgets around 2025-2026.

9. **Leverage AI & Tools (Planning):** Research and select **AI-driven tools** that can support your planned actions. For instance:
   - **Automated Compliance Management:** Tools like RegTech or GRC software can track requirements and evidence. AI features might help keep track of changing regulations or map controls to multiple frameworks.
   - **Static Code Analysis with AI:** Modern static analysis tools (e.g., those using machine learning to reduce false positives) can be integrated into development to catch security flaws early. Choose one that suits your tech stack.
   - **SBOM Generators:** Use automated SBOM generation tools (like Syft, CycloneDX plugins) to produce software bills of materials for each product release. Some tools use AI to identify components in binary firmware as well.
   - **Vulnerability Intelligence:** Consider AI-enhanced threat intel platforms that automatically alert you if new vulnerabilities are found in products similar to yours or in libraries you use. These can serve as an early warning system.

### Phase 4: Implementation of Measures (Months 9-24)

10. **Security Engineering Changes:** Kick off development work for product changes:

- Developers remediate code issues (e.g., remove default creds, upgrade encryption algorithms, integrate libraries that are more secure).
- Implement new features like auto-update mechanisms, logging capabilities, data wipe functionality for users, etc., as required.
- Set up a secure update signing infrastructure if not existing.
- Establish a vulnerability disclosure web portal (could be as simple as a web form that creates a ticket in your system).
- Write or update documentation (technical files, user guides with security info).

Use a **DevSecOps approach**: integrate continuous security scans in your build pipeline. For example, every build triggers SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and dependency checking; any high-severity issue fails the build for fixing. This automation ensures new changes don’t introduce fresh vulnerabilities, keeping you compliant on the fly.

11. **AI-Driven Testing:** During implementation, employ AI tools for testing:

- **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzers (some AI-driven) to automatically generate random inputs to crash or find flaws in your software or device interfaces. This can reveal vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) that need fixing. Modern fuzzing frameworks, sometimes powered by ML to better generate edge-case inputs, can significantly harden products.
- **Penetration Testing with AI Assistance:** While a human pen tester is invaluable, they can use AI tools to augment their work (such as AI that quickly maps open ports/services and suggests exploits). Consider engaging in a **penetration testing round** for critical products after initial fixes. The reports will show if any requirements are still unmet (e.g., maybe a test finds an open debug port – then you address it).
- **Machine Learning for Code Review:** Some AI code assistants (like GPT-4 based tools) can help review code for security issues or even generate remediation suggestions. They can be used by developers to double-check sensitive code sections.

12. **Process and Policy Implementation:** Introduce necessary organizational processes:

- Write a formal **Vulnerability Disclosure Policy** (simple public document stating how to report vulns and commitment to respond) – can be posted on your website.
- Define an **Incident Response Plan** specific to product incidents and align it with the 24h/72h reporting workflow. Train the team on executing this plan. Possibly run an **incident simulation drill** to ensure the team can meet the 24-hour deadline with a dummy incident.
- Set up a **monitoring system** for product security. For software, this might be monitoring error logs or crash reports for signs of exploitation. For devices, maybe an IoT cloud platform that flags anomalies. AI can play a role here: e.g., use anomaly detection algorithms on telemetry to spot if multiple devices are behaving oddly (could indicate a widespread attack).
- Create templates for the **Technical Documentation** and Declaration of Conformity. For each product, ensure engineers fill in required info (maybe create a form or checklist to be completed at product launch).

13. **Engage Third-Party Assessments (if needed):** If your product is in the important/critical category requiring Notified Body or certification, start that process early (it can be time-consuming). Coordinate testing/certification with the external body. Use any pre-certification tools or pre-audits to catch issues. For important products, you might need a **conformity assessment body** to do a type examination or audit – schedule this such that by late 2027 you have the certification in hand. Automation here might include running internal audits using compliance software so that when the external audit happens, everything is in order.

14. **Monitor Standards Development:** Over 2025-2026, EU standards organizations (CEN/CENELEC/ETSI) will develop **harmonized standards** for CRA. Keep track of these (via your industry association or the Official Journal publications). Once available, adopt them, as compliance with harmonized standards gives “presumption of conformity” ([Cyber Resilience Act Requirements Standards Mapping - Joint Research Centre & ENISA Joint Analysis | ENISA](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/cyber-resilience-act-requirements-standards-mapping#:~:text=To%20facilitate%20adoption%20of%20the,possible%20gaps%20to%20be%20addressed)). This can simplify your work because following a standard’s guidelines is a clear path to compliance. If possible, contribute to standards development to ensure your industry’s concerns are considered.

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Months 24-36)

15. **Pilot Compliance on Key Products:** By around 2026, aim to have one or two key products fully CRA-ready as pilot cases. Do a mock conformity assessment on them: verify all documentation is complete, run through the checklist of essential requirements to ensure nothing was missed, maybe have an internal audit team or an external consultant review it. This will highlight any lingering gaps in your interpretation of the CRA. Fix those issues. This pilot can then serve as a template for other products.

16. **Internal Audit & Penetration Test (Final Round):** Conduct an internal audit across all product lines to ensure compliance tasks have been done. Also, consider a final round of penetration testing or bug bounty focus in 2027 on any high-risk products. Fix any last vulnerabilities discovered before the law’s effective date.

17. **Training and Awareness (Ongoing):** Continuously train new employees, refresh training for existing ones, especially developers (since threat landscape evolves – e.g., new secure coding practices). Use e-learning with interactive quizzes on CRA compliance for relevant staff. Automation can help track training completion. Some AI-based training platforms can even simulate phishing or social engineering to test awareness, but in product development context, quizzes on secure coding or scenario-based exercises (like “What do you do if a researcher reports a bug?”) can keep teams sharp.

18. **Final Documentation and CE Marking:** Prepare the final Declarations of Conformity for each product by late 2027. Ensure CE marks are affixed on product packaging or download pages as required. Set up a process to keep these updated for new versions. Essentially, treat the CRA compliance like you would treat electrical safety compliance – integrated into the product release checklist.

19. **Go/No-Go Decision Gates:** Introduce a compliance gate in product launch process: no product (or major update) goes out unless compliance sign-off is obtained. This sign-off means all required security tests passed, documentation ready, etc. This governance ensures sustained compliance even after initial implementation.

### Phase 6: Post-2027 Maintenance (Beyond go-live)

20. **Ongoing Monitoring and Automation:** Once compliant and in operation, rely on **AI-driven monitoring** to maintain security:

- **Real-time Compliance Monitoring:** Some tools can continuously check system configurations or software composition to ensure they remain compliant (like checking that no new component with a known vuln slipped in). “Compliance as code” philosophies suggest encoding security requirements into scripts – for example, an automated nightly job that scans your product builds for any library with a CVE above a certain severity and alerts you, effectively monitoring compliance to “no known exploitable vulnerabilities” rule.
- **Incident Detection AI:** Use AI in your security operations to detect potential incidents on products in the field. For instance, an AI system could flag if multiple crash reports have similar signatures that could indicate an exploit, prompting investigation.

21. **Periodic Reviews and Updates:** Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., annually) of your compliance status and whether any new guidance or delegated acts changed requirements. Also, as you release new versions or new products, iterate through the compliance steps for them. Update your processes based on any regulatory updates (ENISA and the CRA Expert Group will likely issue interpretations or best practices over time).

22. **Cost-Benefit Analysis of AI vs Manual Efforts:** Throughout these phases, evaluate how the AI tools are performing versus manual work:

- *Cost:* AI tools often have licensing costs, but they can reduce labor. For instance, an AI-powered scanning tool might replace dozens of manual code review hours ([How will rules and regulations affect cybersecurity and AI in 2025? | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/feature/how-will-rules-and-regulations-affect-cybersecurity-and-ai-in-2025#:~:text=As%20frameworks%20like%20FedRAMP%20and,identify%20risks%20and%20cut%20costs)). Compare the expense of tools to the saved engineer hours and the reduction in vulnerabilities (which have their own cost if left).
- *Benefit:* Track metrics like number of vulnerabilities detected pre-release, time taken to remediate, compliance audit results, etc. If AI tools are catching 90% of issues and freeing up your security engineers to focus on complex problems, that’s a big win. On the flip side, if a tool produces many false positives that engineers waste time on, consider tuning or switching it.
- **Example:** Manual compliance (without AI) might mean security experts painstakingly review thousands of lines of code or numerous configurations – time-consuming and error-prone. AI-driven analysis can rapidly scan codebases and flag likely security issues, letting humans verify and fix. This hybrid approach yields thorough coverage at lower time cost. Another example is incident response: manually sifting through logs across millions of IoT devices is near impossible, but an AI system can crunch that data and point analysts to anomalies, massively reducing detection time.

Over time, you should see a **reduction in vulnerabilities and incidents**, which is a quantifiable benefit (fewer emergency patches, less downtime, no fines). Also factor in the intangible but real benefit of maintaining customer trust and avoiding damage that a major security incident or compliance failure would bring.

23. **Adaptive Improvement:** Use the data from AI tools to continuously improve. If your AI code scanner finds certain patterns repeatedly, train developers to avoid those patterns (maybe the AI tool even provides code fixes). If your AI incident detector had false alarms, adjust its models. Essentially, treat AI as a partner that learns with you – the better your processes get, the more you can fine-tune automation to your context.

By following these phased steps, companies can **gradually reach full CRA compliance by the deadline**, instead of rushing at the last minute. Starting early also spreads out costs and allows using strategic investments in AI/automation to streamline the work.

**Urgency vs. Long-Term Integration:** It’s worth noting that while the final compliance deadline for most requirements is end of 2027 (long-term), some actions are urgent. Specifically, **incident and vulnerability reporting obligations by September 2026** mean you must have those mechanisms well before the main date ([The EU Cyber Resilience Act: Implications for Companies](https://www.hoganlovells.com/en/publications/the-eu-cyber-resilience-act-implications-for-companies-#:~:text=applicability%20will%20commence%20after%20a,products%20from%2011%20September%202026)). So early phases should prioritize setting up the reporting and monitoring processes (Phase 4 steps like incident response plan and vulnerability disclosure need to be done by mid-2026). On the other hand, some design improvements can be rolled into your normal product refresh cycles over the next couple of years (long-term planning). This dual approach – address urgent needs now (like establishing a CSIRT link, stopping shipping new products with obvious flaws) while embedding other improvements into your R&D roadmap – ensures compliance does not completely derail ongoing business.

## Case Example (Hypothetical)

A mid-sized smart home device maker followed these steps and used automation. In Phase 2, they employed an AI-powered static analysis tool which found several buffer overflow risks in their camera firmware – issues their small team might have missed manually. They fixed those early, avoiding potential exploits. They also generated SBOMs for each firmware build automatically, so when the “Heartbleed 2.0” vulnerability hit a common library in 2026, their systems immediately alerted that firmware versions X, Y were affected, and they patched within days. Come 2027, they had all documentation ready, and a Notified Body review (since cameras with security functions were an important-class product) went smoothly as they had evidence for each requirement. The cost of the AI tools and a security engineer hire was significant, but it saved them from a costly recall or fine, and they marketed their devices as “EU Cyber Resilience Act ready”, gaining trust and an edge in the market.

In conclusion, **AI and automation are force multipliers** in achieving CRA compliance. They handle complexity and scale – scanning millions of lines of code, monitoring thousands of devices, checking compliance status continuously – tasks that would overwhelm human teams alone. By smartly integrating these tools into a phased compliance roadmap, companies can not only meet the CRA obligations on time but do so efficiently and with an eye toward ongoing cyber resilience beyond mere compliance ([How will rules and regulations affect cybersecurity and AI in 2025? | SC Media](https://www.scworld.com/feature/how-will-rules-and-regulations-affect-cybersecurity-and-ai-in-2025#:~:text=As%20frameworks%20like%20FedRAMP%20and,identify%20risks%20and%20cut%20costs)). The result is a sustainable security-by-design culture that will serve the organization well as cyber threats and regulations continue to evolve.
